# Succession Economy Intelligence Agent

This repository aggregates market intelligence materials that inform analyses of the "succession economy"—the set of economic activities linked to ownership transitions of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). The collection focuses on G7 markets and consolidates quantitative datasets with qualitative research artifacts to support diligence, scoring, and policy exploration.

## Getting Started

The workbooks and PDFs provide raw intelligence. Analysts typically ingest the spreadsheets into their preferred BI environment or data science toolkit. Suggested steps:

1. **Inventory the data**: Review workbook tabs to understand available metrics, dimensions, and data freshness.
2. **Connect tooling**: Import the sheets into platforms like Excel, Power BI, Tableau, or Python/R notebooks for deeper analysis.
3. **Synthesize insights**: Combine quantitative indicators with qualitative briefings to craft narratives, scorecards, and investment theses.
4. **Operationalize**: Translate insights into action plans for operator corps development, policy advocacy, or investment diligence.
